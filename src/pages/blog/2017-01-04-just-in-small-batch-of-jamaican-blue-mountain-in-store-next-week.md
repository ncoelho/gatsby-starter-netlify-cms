If you told me 12 months ago that I would be teaching people how to do the things that used to give me anxiety - I would’ve told you to “go home, you drunk!”. 🤦🏻‍♀️

Last year was probably the lowest point of my career. People were getting promoted left and right. Except for me, it seemed. 😞 Even people with less to 0 experience in Product Management in comparison to myself were put in equal job level or higher. I felt left behind.

Imagine the havoc that wreaked on my confidence. I started thinking that I was not getting promoted because I just sucked. And despite all the good feedback I was getting - I kept thinking “meh. 🤷🏻‍♀️”. I was good. But apparently, never good enough.

This also affected my day to day! Even daily successes, I found difficult to own. I was lucky. I had good timing. I work with an amazing team! These were the reasons for any success. Except me. 🙅🏻‍♀️

It was just easier to wallow in insecurity. Thinking that promotion will come when I well and truly deserve it. Which, at that point, seemed never.

Good thing I had people who helped make sure I didn't stay in that rut. Who didn't believe that I was in the right job level - a seemingly simple, organizational problem but has snowballed into so many things. Friends who pushed me to fight for that promotion and question decisions made around this. Expert friends who taught me how to have these conversations with my managers. And managers who listened and took my concern seriously and fought alongside me. 👯‍♀️

Suffice to say - i did get that promotion. And another one 6 months after that. And a bonus. And more importantly, my confidence back! Not just to challenge promotions, but also to take control of my career and have more ambitious goals for myself. And seek out opportunities to support them. Who would've thought that I’d be teaching Product Management or Presenting after all of that?! Not me! 🙇🏻‍♀️

And this is why I started Career Hacking for Women with Eli and Ferdaws. I wanted to make sure that everybody can have access to the support and tools that I had that helped to get me here. And to make sure that WE are not the biggest barriers to our own successes. 💙
